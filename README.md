# Thulium-Beta
A "Better" version of old Thulium but is as outdated as old Thulium

Please don't use this pasta you really don't want to.

This paste is based on TrashHack and BameWare.

Currently most of it is outdated and I wouldn't recommend using it or even trying to fix it. (Aimbot, Visuals, Antiaims, and Misc features 
are fucked!)
